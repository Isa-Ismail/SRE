internet connection. The product will require a keyboard, mouse and monitor to interface
with the user. The minimum hardware requirements for the product are specified in this
document.
### 2.2 Product Features
Some key features of the product will be, login portal, dashboard, profile management,
research/thesis paper. Profiling management includes profile of ICT departments’ students,
teachers & admins. From the dashboard everyone will be able to see notices like, exam schedule, events, club activities etc. Research and thesis papers will also be accessible from

And it can be run on any modern devices like, mobile phone, desktop, laptop, pad.
### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
The current constrains on the project are related to the provision of these resources:
 As we are bound on time, we may not be able to fully develop the system with all the
features and functions.
 Our team has only hand full of developers, it will be hard for us to develop the
software as we want.
 To test, host and run the system we will need money which is also a constrain.
 The web portal will be constrained by the capacity of the database.
 The user cannot change their details without getting permission from the admin.
 The internet connection is also a constraint for the application. Since the application
cannot be run without the internet.
